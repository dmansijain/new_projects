						By signing below, I acknowledge that I have read, understand, and agree to the following terms and conditions that will be in effect before, during, and after my involvement with Liminal's Program and its program guidelines.

I agree to accept the concept of a chemical-free existence during the program. This means abstinence from all mind and mood affecting drugs and chemicals (excluding those prescribed by a physician), including alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. I agree to remain abstinent from mind and mood affecting drugs and chemicals at least 15 days before the start of my program. I understand that any use of these chemicals may result in my discharge from the program.

Since this is a nicotine-free program, participants who smoke or use tobacco in other forms will address their nicotine use as a part of this program. I understand I will be required to abstain upon my arrival to the program and throughout my stay.

I understand this is a prepaid program, and I agree to meet all financial requirements at the time of registration of the program. In addition to Liminal's pre-program registration and cancellation fee policies, I understand the program is on a "fee for service" basis. This means that since Liminal has made prior arrangements and incurred costs to provide said services for me, I will not be entitled to or receive a refund of any fees I have paid for any reason, even if I do not participate in or receive all of the services scheduled for me. Whether I complete the program as scheduled, or I am discharged from, or I discharge myself from the program before its completion, I understand I will not be entitled to or receive a refund of any portion of the prepaid program costs, including transportation to or from the program site.

I understand that seeking and receiving insurance reimbursement is solely my responsibility and not the responsibility of Liminal. Liminal does not provide DSM psychological diagnosis or CPT codes to insurance companies.

I understand and accept that Liminal makes no explicit or implied guarantees or warranties as to my successful completion of the program, the quality of my experience during the program, or my post-program experiences directly or indirectly resulting from my participation in the program.

I understand my participation in this program is voluntary, and the program may be physically and emotionally intense. I agree to accept such risks and I assume responsibility for such stress/distress and/or other effects of my participation. I hereby release, discharge and hold harmless Liminal Partners, LLC and all of its staff of and from any and all claims, causes of action, demands, or judgments arising out of or in any way connected with my participation in the Liminal’s program and all related activities, including those arising out of the negligence of any of the aforementioned parties. I understand that participation in any of these activities contains certain risks of physical injury or death. I agree to assume fully the risk of injury or death arising from any such activity.

I understand I have the responsibility of assuming a leadership role regarding my own care and safety in this workshop.

As a condition of acceptance in the program, I agree to provide my complete medical history as provided for by the form entitled Health Questionnaire and incorporated herein as if fully set forth in this contract.  Please be aware that when you share information with Liminal via email, Liminal cannot guarantee the confidentiality of that information due to the nature of the Internet. Receiving an email from you will be understood as permission to respond to you by email. Giving us your email implies consent to contact you via email regarding upcoming programs or administrative concerns. This implied permission may be revoked by you at any time by contacting us by phone, email, or in writing. No personal health information will be transmitted unless it is in response to your email to us. Additionally, the use of cell phones is not a guarantee of privacy in communicating. When you contact Liminal staff, you may or may not be calling a cell phone.

I understand and agree that it may be necessary to make my medical history available to a hospital, physician, or other health care provider in the event that I am in need of medical treatment; therefore, I authorize Liminal to release my medical history for that purpose. In the event of any medical emergency, I hereby authorize and give my full consent to Liminal personnel to take all appropriate measures to provide me with medical assistance including, if appropriate, permission to transfer me to another facility.

I understand that my participation in the program will involve interaction with other program participants who may have a contagious/infectious disease which may include but are not limited to known and unknown flu viruses, Hepatitis, HIV, bacterial infections, etc. and that Liminal takes universal precautions for the safety of all participants. I agree to assume the risk of such exposure and I agree to hold Liminal Partners harmless and free from any and all claims, including reasonable attorney fees.

I understand that some Liminal events are hosted in remote locations and that wild or stray animals may come onto the property and that Liminal is not liable for any injury.

I understand that firearms, ammunition, or weapons of any kind are not allowed on property at any time.  A gun permit does not authorize a participant to bring firearms onto the property, or any buildings, that the Liminal event is hosted at under any circumstances.

I agree not to engage in any activity that may cause damage to the property at which the Liminal event is being hosted. If damage does occur, I agree to pay the full amount of damages. I also agree not to remove any items (including but not limited to pillows, blankets, etc.) from the rooms located at the property and understand that if objects are removed, I am financially responsible for replacing missing objects.

I have fully and truthfully disclosed all information regarding my medical and physical history, including and medical conditions and medications which I am currently taking, whether prescribed or not.

I have fully and truthfully completed the program assessment and all other documents provided by program staff.

The program will take place in a retreat setting. As such, I understand that the program participants, including myself, are not in a licensed health care setting or facility and will not receive medical supervision or monitoring. The program experience is designed to promote wellness and improve the ability of participants to function in a healthier manner emotionally, spiritually, and psychologically. The program experience is not a substitute for inpatient nor extended outpatient treatment.

I will not reveal nor discuss outside of any group process anything that happens, is said, or done within any group process. I will not reveal the identities of any participants, family members, or program participants who are or may have been at the Liminal event. I understand that violation of this confidentiality pledge will be grounds for immediate dismissal from any/all Liminal programs and may subject me to civil and/or criminal penalties.

I understand that Liminal operates under strict privacy policies but cannot guarantee that all group members will keep strict confidentiality.  I also understand that Liminal cannot completely control the nature of information participants may reveal about themselves in the group process.

I authorize Liminal staff to contact me via electronic mail. I further understand correspondence may be confidential in nature and electronic mail is not a secure form of communication.

I have reviewed this agreement and all program documentation I’ve been provided carefully. I have been informed, to my satisfaction, as to what may occur during the program.

I state that I have carefully read the foregoing terms and conditions, know the contents thereof, and I sign the same as my own free act.
I hereby agree to accept and abide by the policies, guidelines, conditions, and procedures as set forth in the agreement and the Program Guidelines.
